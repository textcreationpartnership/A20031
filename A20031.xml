            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19959:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> pious ſupplication prepared to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to his Maieſty for Reformation of certain corruptions crept into our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or rather left in them by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt at his extruſion, forthwith pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the ſame in print, together with an anſwer thereto (ſuch as it is) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and maintaining all or moſt of the ſayd corruptions ſo intended to bee petitioned against, and that in the name of the <hi>Vice-chancellor,</hi> the <hi>Doctors,</hi> both the <hi>Proctors,</hi> and other the <hi>Heads</hi> of houſes in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> avouching it to bee agreeable undoubtedly to the ioynt and uniforme opinion of all the <hi>Deanes</hi> and <hi>Chapiters,</hi> and all other the learned and obedient Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to bee confirmed by the expreſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Vniverſitie of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> although many of them both <hi>Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Heads</hi> of Houſes in either Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and members of Chapiters otherwhere in the Land, and alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:19959:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> more of the obedient Clergie were openly knowne to be of contrary iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto them in the particulars mentioned in the Petition, and by theſe men defended, and moſt of the reſidue never ſaw, nor once heard of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, untill it was published in print. Such was their boldneſſe. Not long after, ſome of the chiefeſt Miniſters, that were intereſſed in the ſame Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, penned this diſcourſe following in defence of the ſaid Petition, and reply to the aboue mentioned Anſwer, which hath been obſcured from that time till now, partly for the reaſons aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, and partly becauſe ſuch is the woefull coldneſſe of theſe back-ſliding dayes, that even thoſe which ſeemed heretofore moſt forward for Church-reformation, are ſo declined, that they like not ſo much as to heare of that, that may in any ſort once ſeeme to threaten the leaſt hinderance of their worldly profit, or diſquiet to their carnall peace, be it never ſo healthfull to
<pb facs="tcp:19959:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> their ſoules. Inſomuch that they are ſo farre from being aiding and aſsiſting to Chriſt, in this his cauſe, either by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or coſt, that when bookes are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in defence thereof for their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and inſtruction, they either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to buy the ſame, or having bought them, caſt them aſide into ſome hole or corner, never vouchſafing to peruſe them: yet <hi>Wiſedom is iuſtified of her children,</hi> and ſome enter the gate of life be it never ſo ſtraight; and walk in the Lords way, be it never ſo narrow. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obiect, that theſe are no matters of ſalvation, but of leſſe moment, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be ſo much ſtood upon; Let him heare for anſwer, That no man can haue ſound aſſurance of being exempt from confuſion, that hath not <hi>reſpect to all Gods commandements</hi> to the beſt he is able, as well leſser as greater. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. neither may any hope for plenary redemption by Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that is not willing to yeeld plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obedience to his Propheſie, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb facs="tcp:19959:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſeeing he onely is with God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted truely gracious, that giveth himſelfe both to learne all that God teacheth concerning him in his place, and to practiſe whatſoever God ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to know. Affected ignorance refuſing neceſſary knowledge, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rebellion against the light receiued, being alike deteſtable before the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now that the knowledge of theſe poynts is very needfull for all ſorts of Chriſtians, whether of higher or lower degree, and of what Calling ſoever, may moſt evidently appeare by theſe reaſons, to omit ſundry other.</p>
            <p>Firſt becauſe many of them are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of daily practiſe, even of all ſorts and rankes of perſons amongst us, and will any ſay that it is, or can be ſafe for a man in the ſpeciall ſervice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, to doe either hee careth not, or knoweth not what?</p>
            <p>Secondly, for that they mainly tend to the honour or dishonour of that Lord whom we all profeſſe to ſerue, and shall
<pb facs="tcp:19959:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> his glory be ſo lightly regarded by vs?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they make directly either to the beautifying or deforming of the viſible Church, which is the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whereof wee are members, every one for his part. And can any godly minde be careleſſe hereof?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they doe plainly ſerue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the edification or deſtruction of themſelues, and many other of their deere brethren, for whom Chriſt died, chiefly by their myſticall ſignification: who then can iudge them to bee of ſmall moment?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, many of the liuely members of Christ ſuffer for them unto impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſides many other miſeries, yea even unto a languishing death: And will any good Chriſtian fall under the fearfull doom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. 43. for not viſiting &amp; helping Chriſt perſecuted in his members? Or shall we endanger our ſelues to that dreadfull curſe, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 28. for neglecting to helpe the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:19959:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> the mighty? <hi>God forbid.</hi> Or shall any perſwade us in thoſe things to go on careleſſe or blind-fold without diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether we pleaſe or diſpleaſe God in our doings? Far be it from us; for <hi>that which is not of knowledge, can not be of faith. Rom.</hi> 10. 17. and <hi>whatſoever is not of faith cannot be pleaſing to God. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>but is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14. 23. and <hi>the wages of ſin is death. Rom.</hi> 6. 23. I trow no gracious heart will eſteem any ſin light, or the wages thereof triviall. Wherefore in the feare of God let all men beware how they do ſo ſlightly eſteem theſe matters ſo frequent in practiſe, neere to Gods ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſence, for which his Glory, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Children ſuffer ſo many, and ſo great evils. Indeed they are not to bee ranked with things of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but yet ſeing it is apparant, that no man among us (eſpecially as things now ſtand) can without manifold ſins neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them: therfore foraſmuch as beſides ſundry other treatiſes handling the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:19959:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> matters, this offreth it ſelfe to thy view, be not unwilling duely to conſider what is ſayd on both ſides, and the Lord giue thee underſtanding to diſcerne truth from falſhood, and good from evill, that thou mayeſt reject and eſchew the one, and embrace and follow the other. On the one ſide thou mayeſt preſume as much is ſayd as probably can be, ſeeing it is the fruit of ſo many learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors labours, as the title boaſteth of: yet if the other haue not more ſincerity, and ſoundneſſe of truth and reaſon, I deſire not it should finde any favour in thy ſight: but if yea, then do as God shall moue thine heart, and even ſo I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to thy diligent reading, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and godly iudgement, and thee to the guidance of the moſt high.</p>
            <p>Moreover, whereas of late there is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a certaine Scholasticall (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ſayd Sophiſtical) Tract, moſtly of the ſame ſubiect, by one <hi>M. Sprint,</hi> a <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtershire</hi> Miniſter, entituled, <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander Anglicanus,</hi> tending in a ſort
<pb facs="tcp:19959:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the patronizing of theſe Popish cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies here treated of, which may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the ſtumbling of ſome weak ones: although I heare that by Gods mercy, it is fully reſolued upon ſome time ſince, that the ſayd Tract shall be at large an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and confuted. Yet for the ſtay of the feebler ſort in the meane time, that are leſſe able to diſcerne how hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is therein deceived, and deceiveth others, I offer to conſideration: Firſt, a few things obſervable in the Tract it ſelfe; and ſecondly, certaine Tables written heretofore by the ſame Author, touching the ſame ſubiect, and by him entituled, <hi>The Anatomy of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Bellum Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniale.</hi> The Tables I haue annexed hereto, deſiring thee, that if thou haue his foreſayd. <hi>Tract</hi> by thee, thou wilt be pleaſed to compare them together; and then with indifferent iudgement giue ſentence, whether is more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the truth, this or the other. Deny them to be his owne in any part, as I am
<pb facs="tcp:19959:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> aſſured he cannot; ſo, I hope he will not once be willing to do, chiefly ſeeing there are ſo many living witneſſes thereof: And that they are more ſutable to the ſincerity of the Goſpell, and the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a good Chriſtians conſcience, I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt, but that all men equally affected, upon due ſurvey of both, will most eaſily and freely grant. Of what validity or worth then this his later worke is, I leaue to the understanding Reader to iudge, doubtleſſe that his <hi>Anatomie</hi> and <hi>Bellum Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale,</hi> can never bee reconciled to this his <hi>Caſſander Anglicanus,</hi> but doth most clearely contradict and confute the ſame, evincing it to be utterly errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unſound. And concerning the Tract it ſelfe, I obſerue divers things worthy to bee remarked: Firſt, it hath met with ſome <hi>Ieſuit-like Index ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius:</hi> For, falling into the hands of the Prelates (or at leaſt of ſome of their Chaplaines) not to ſpeake of other Purgations, it is in one place purged of
<pb facs="tcp:19959:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> this whole <hi>Paragraphe</hi> following, ſcil: <hi>It ſcandalizeth and offendeth the Bishops, making them guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins, in depriving ſo many and ſo worthy Miniſters for trifling cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: which hindering and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to preach, is by the H. Ghoſt reproved and plagued.</hi> Amos. 2. 12. &amp; 8. 12. Act. 17. &amp; 4. 18. &amp; 5. 28. 1. Theſs. 2. 16. <hi>As for example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, to put by Gods ſubſtantiall &amp; neceſſary worships by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for trifling and indifferent ceremonies of humane invention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, to rob the people of the appoynted food of their ſoules, and</hi> ordinary meanes of their faith, Rom. 10. 17. Regeneration. 1. Cor. 4. 16. and ſalvation, 1. Cor. 1. 21, <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſo great importance for trifles of ſo ſmall conſequence; yea for theſe things to take away many a true Sheppard, and to commit or leaue the flock unto many a Wolfe and blind guide, which will either</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19959:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>make havock of them, or lead them into the ditch of deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, to leaue the Papiſts cauſe wholy,</hi> 1. <hi>by retaining their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> 2. <hi>ſuppreſſing our beſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> 3. <hi>by withdrawing or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending the gifts of themſelues and others to mutuall brawles, and ſo to giue them reſt to miſchiefe the Church, and increaſe their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi> 4. <hi>by opening their mouth to blaſpheme the Goſpell by theſe our mutuall brables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, to driue many hereby on the rock of Schiſme, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Separation: the plentifull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience whereof hath bred much griefe in the hearts of the well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, to undoe ſo many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and their families, of very good deſert, of the meanes of their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, to their utter undoing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo fitted for the Miniſterie, and unfitted for any thing elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:19959:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, to cauſe the Sabboth, a morall precept of God, to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned for ceremonies of mens ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and that in ſo many places of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, to punish the people for the fault of their Paſtor (if any be:) For it is the Miniſter that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth not, but by his ſilencing the people are plagued,</hi> Pro. 29. 18. Hoſea. 4. 6. <hi>This is iniuſtice to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish one man for the offence of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly, to do a thing cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that themſelues pray for, at leaſt which Chriſt commands to pray for. For Chriſt commands his</hi> to pray to the LORD of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, that he would thruſt forth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his harveſt; <hi>which when he hath done, they thruſt them out.</hi> Math. 9. 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly, it utterly undoeth the Miniſter (a painfull labourer of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt) as alſo his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19959:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>and diſableth them to liue, which by Gods apoyntment should be maintained,</hi> 1. Cor. 9. 14. <hi>yea well maintainded,</hi> 1. Tim. 5. 17. <hi>This is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the law of loue &amp; Iuſtice.</hi> Whereby it doth manifeſtly appeare, that the Authour is very groſly abuſed, becauſe his whole minde is not publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but ſo much onely as beſt ſerveth the Prelates turne, a trick not unuſuall with them for their advantage. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe amongst others the English tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Bucanus</hi> his <hi>Common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Whereout the Authours diſcourſe touching Diſcipline (tranſlated by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Hill,</hi> yea imprinted) is taken, and a diſcourſe of Bishops governement put into the roome thereof; both without Doctor <hi>Hils</hi> knowledge. Nay, hath not this <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> tampered with the holy Scriptures themſelues? Obſerue for the preſent but two places, Act. 14. 23. is thus tranſlated, not onely in the <hi>Geneva,</hi> but alſo in the former Church tranſlation, <hi>And when they</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19959:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>had ordained them Elders by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But the new tranſlation with the Rhemiſts, leaveth out theſe words, <hi>by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi> Why? It is not to be ſuffered, that the people should haue any hand in chuſing their miniſters, but papal Bishops muſt do all, 1. Cor. 12. 28. is tranſlated both by the <hi>Geneva,</hi> and former Church tranſlation, <hi>Helpers, Governors;</hi> but the new tranſlators herein worſe then the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> tranſlate it <hi>Helpes in governments,</hi> foisting into the Text this prepoſition <hi>[in.]</hi> Why? They cannot abide Elders to aſsiſt the miniſter in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Chriſt his Church. So that Curchwardens are but the Prelats pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters. But we muſt paſſe by this as their natural weakneſſe, ſeeing it is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in with the milk of their mother, ſcil. the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom they haue receiued their callings, &amp; alſo theſe corruptions thus by them pleaded for, together with this unſcholler like, nay dishoneſt means of upholding the ſame.</p>
            <p>2 The tearmes of the main concluſion
<pb facs="tcp:19959:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the whole Tractate are to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. ſcil. <hi>It is neceſſary for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to conforme to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies preſcribed in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>rather then to ſuffer depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Where it is to be noted, 1. that he ſpeaketh not one word in defence of the ſubſcription required, and yet most, if not all theſe that are debarred from the execution of the worke of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in our Churches, whether they haue been heretofore ſilenced, or not, are debarred principally for refuſall of the ſayd ſubſcription. To very little purpoſe therefore are his foure inferences layd down in the third page of his book; nay in truth to very little purpoſe were his whole book, were he able to iuſtifie all he hath written, which all wiſe men may eaſily perceiue that he is never able to performe.</p>
            <p>2. That he ſpeaketh ſo ſaintly for thoſe ceremonies, that not daring to ſay, the required conformity is neceſſary, either in it ſelf, or in reſpect of the Magiſtrates
<pb facs="tcp:19959:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> command, he ſayth onely this, <hi>That it is neceſſaty rather then to ſuffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation.</hi> So that as in the <hi>Paragraph</hi> gelded by the Prelats, it is evident, that <hi>extra caſum deprivationis,</hi> a Minister is not to bee blamed for not conforming to them in this Authors iudgement; nay that the Prelats are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther utterly to be blamed for requiring Conformity thereto.</p>
            <p>3 Every of thoſe three arguments, whereby hee endevoureth to proue this concluſion, falleth as much too short of proving the concluſion, as the concluſion it ſelfe doth of condemning the ſilenced Miniſters of ſin for not conforming ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to ſuffer deprivation, which are not deprived for not conforming, but for not ſubſcribing, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe amongst his religious friends hath often both of old, and alſo of late profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he neither would nor could yeeld to do for any mans pleaſure under heauen, what loſſe or punishment ſoever he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered therefore.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:19959:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The firſt Argument drawne from the doctrine and practiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who taught that the Iewish Ceremonies were <hi>beggerly rudiments, Traditions, Will-worships, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Men, &amp;c.</hi> and yet did practiſe the ſame; beſides many other iuſt exceptions, is guilty of the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>à bene diviſis ad male coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta,</hi> ſeeing it is altogether as falſe, that the Apoſtle did ſo teach, and yet ſo practiſe in the ſame Churches, as it is true that they did ſo teach, and yet ſo practiſe at all. For among the Iewes, and in their Churches onely did they ſo practiſe, to whom thoſe <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were even lately before the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordinances of God given by God himſelf, for their edification &amp; training up in religion to eternall life. And the Author hath utterly failed to proue that the Apoſtles did ſo teach as is aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, in any of thoſe Churches, but onely in the Gentile Churches, to whom they were never given by God
<pb facs="tcp:19959:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> to any ſuch end, nor indeed at all, and there the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> would not by any meanes ſuffer the uſe and practiſe of thoſe Ceremonies to bee brought in, no not for the ſpace of an houre, <hi>Galath.</hi> 2. 5. but rather sharply reproved <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> openly and to the face, for giving way thereunto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14. lest by building againe the things hee had deſtroyed, he should make himſelfe a tranſgreſſer, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 18. And hereto agree the reſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 25. And if hee would not giue way, no not for an houre, that the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Ceremonies should be uſed in the Gentile Churches, although they had lately been unto the Iewes <hi>(of whom came ſalvation, Ioh.</hi> 4. 22.) the heavenly Ordinances of GOD, giuen them for their building up in grace, how much leſſe would hee haue ſuffered our rotten and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ceremonies to haue been brought in, that never had better birth, then from Hell by the Divell, and
<pb facs="tcp:19959:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> Antichrist, for the defacing of Gods glory, and deſtruction of his people. Wherefore the doctrine and practiſe of the Apoſtles is moſt fully and flatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him in this poynt, and his falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious argument worſe then ſie upon it. Yet further, If thoſe ceremonies did turn the Gentile Churches from the truth, as he ſayth, quoting for proofe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 14. which once having in them the breath <hi>of life,</hi> led the Iewes to the truth, even to Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. Whither do ours, that never had better breath in them, then the poyſon of deſtruction, turne, yea driue and thruſt men.</p>
            <p>As for the Apoſtles enioyning the Gentiles to abſtain from bloud &amp; ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, himſelfe doth giue ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it. Where, by diſtinguishing, hee sheweth, that ours are not of the like kinde, ſeeing the practiſe of the one ſtands in matter of abſtinence, and of the other in matter of action, and ſo do differ <hi>toto coelo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> it is needfull for this man, in
<pb facs="tcp:19959:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> mine opinion, to repent himſelfe of his accuſing the Apoſtles of the Lord, yea the Holy Ghoſt it ſelfe, to teach one thing and practiſe the contrary. Which can be no leſſe (the holy Ghoſt it ſelfe being iudge) then to build by doctrine, and deſtroy by practiſe the ſame things, and ſo to be guilty of tranſgreſsion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 18. And his ſecond argument is no better then the first, being plainly guilty of the fallacy which Schollers call <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio elenchi:</hi> for the argument lieth, as if the duties therein mentioned, were both affirmatiue: which is utterly falſe. For we profeſſe our ſelues reſtrained by the negatiue part of the <hi>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               </hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. Now let him, if he can, shew where any negatiue part of the firſt Table is to giue place to any affirmatiue of either firſt or ſecond, and then I will confeſſe, that he hath ſpoken more then is to bee found in all his impertinent and confuſed rumble about this poynt, and alſo, that he hath <hi>anihilated</hi> that old diſtinction of Schoolemen, ſcil. of
<pb facs="tcp:19959:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> Commandements binding <hi>ſemper,</hi> or <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> neither will it ſuffice to tell us of Sacrifices of the old Teſtament, which fell under the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not immediatly, but mediatly, ſcil. <hi>mediante praecepto ceremonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> ſo that in this, as in the former, there are very many words, and much labour beſtowed altogether beſide the poynt in queſtion, and the whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is utterly deceitfull.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the one of the duties here by him compared, ſcil. the bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the Ceremonies, is but one conſequent among many, flowing from our obedience to the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in refuſing the ſayd conformitie. Now what good dealing is this, first to change the nature of the precept, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we perform obedience in refuſing the ſayd conformity from negatiue to affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue, and then to put one conſequent of many flowing from this obedience, for the whole obedience it ſelfe? If this be not deceitful dealing, what is, or can be.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:19959:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Lastly, if this Argument of his bee ſo firme and good againſt us, as hee would haue his Reader beleeue, then I deſire him in his next, to teach mee how to free <hi>Shadrach, Meshach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. from being worthy of blame. For if their caſe should fall under ſuch <hi>Legier-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> as this of his, a man might call their refuſing to fall downe before the golden image, nothing more but a bearing witneſſe againſt the image, and ſay, that they being great Magiſtrates, did preferre the bearing witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the image a leſſe dutie, before the duties of the Magiſtracie, and of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their owne liues, which by this mans reckning, should be greater duties, and ſo be guilty of ſin in ſo doing. For that the loſſe of the liues, and deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo great places in the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of three ſo gracious and eminent perſons as theſe, is of greater moment and conſequence, then the depriuation of any three of us from our Miniſtery, none can reaſonably deny. The like may
<pb facs="tcp:19959:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> be ſayd of very many of the Martyrs of Chriſt, both former and later: but a taſt is as much as I intend, this therefore shall ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Neither is his third and laſt argument any thing. leſſe ill, but rather worſe, if worſe may be, then either of the former. For it is liable to both the parts of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Proteſtants anſwer to the Papiſts argument of vniverſality, and more then ſo: For first, to patch up his forged vniverſality, hee foysteth in a multitude of corrupt Fathers, &amp; brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper fellowes, being <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or worſe, which approving almoſt all the ſuperſtitious ceremonies of Papiſtry, are in this caſe no competent iudges, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable witneſſes. Secondly, he cannot be ignorant, that all <hi>Orthodox</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do anſwer the Papiſts thus: That an argument from humane authority in ſuch a caſe, is very inſufficient. And laſtly, he well knoweth, that all incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent iudges or witneſſes ſet a part, hee hath been offered to his face an <hi>Oliver</hi> for a <hi>Rowla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> readily to be given him,
<pb facs="tcp:19959:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> and more then ſo (that is) more witneſſes of the truely <hi>Orthodox</hi> to be againſt him, then he can find to be with him, ſo that neither is this conſent ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, as he boaſteth of, nor if it were, is it any thing worth in this caſe, and ſo both antecedent and conſequence are both naught. Alſo what a multitude of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, nay worſe then Papall rites both his ancienter and later witneſſes maintain, himſelf in this his Tractate being iudge; I leaue to the Iudicious Reader to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for they are ſo many and ſo beaſtly, that I wil never once defile my pen with relating them. Onely this queſtion I will propound to the Author, deſiring him as in Gods preſence to anſwer me. ſcil. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reſidue of the Papiſts ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies may not be maintained by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as well as theſe of ours? And if yea; then why he doth not as well blame all <hi>Orthodox</hi> Proteſtants for rejecting the one, as for refuſing the other? yea, why hee doth not alſo perſwade all <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> in matter of Ceremony, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>But a little to ſearch the antiquitie of it, we muſt firſt agree what croſſe it is which wee ſo oppugne, and our brethren ſtand for. To croſſe the water in baptiſme? or to croſſe the child in baptiſme. To croſſe the water is ſuperſtitious (though the Fathers liked it) and therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath removed it.

The ceremonies that muſt be uſed, muſt haue three conditions.</p>
               <p>1. They muſt be ſuch as ſerue for come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and order ſake, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let all things he done comely and in order.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.</note> But the croſſe in baptiſme is not ſuch: for if it make a <hi>Decorum</hi> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and all the reformed Churches of Geneva, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, Helvetia, Belgia, Poland, &amp;c. that uſe it not, muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit an <hi>Indecorum,</hi> which were abſurd to affirme. Thus <hi>Peter</hi>

Admit this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Iohn and Chriſt, and the Primitiue Church hath baptized indecently, diſordered<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c. Quia eorum baptiſmus iſtis omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus carebat: Becauſe their baptiſme wanted all theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Ceremonies muſt not be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and offenſiue, eſpecially to our <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32.</note> brethren, and to Gods Church, but the croſſe is offenſiue and ſcandalous both to other Churches that account it a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <note place="margin">

               <p>3. They muſt not be idle and needleſſe ceremonies, but to ſuch onely, as be needfull. See the whole Senate of the Apoſtles conclude in their councell. <hi>It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and to us to</hi>

                  <hi>lay no burthen upon you, praeter neceſſaria haec, beſide theſe neceſſary things:</hi> but the croſſe in baptiſme is not neceſſarie either <hi>ad eſſe</hi> to the being, or <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> to the wel being of the Sacrament not <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> the very papiſts confeſſe: nor <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19959:46"/> the Sacrament may be well enough <note place="margin">Lumb. ut ſupra.</note> without it, as the very booke confeſſeth in private baptiſme where no croſſe is uſed yet the miniſter is preſcribed to ſay: <hi>I certifie you that ye haue done well, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>

               </p>
               <p>VVherfore (moſt Noble King) 1. ſeing the croſſe in baptiſme is a departing from the plaine &amp; ſimple inſtitution of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt. 2.

               <p>2.

There are diverſe hundred points of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, wherein Proteſtants and Papiſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; the fourth part of them is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in that booke.

               <p>3. VVee put not weapons into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries hand to wound us, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of unſound teaching, but they giue occaſion &amp; advantage to them that depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the curra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctrine of the Proteſtants, and refine over the old Popiſh dregges. VVherefore our brethrens words <hi>(it bad been good that theſe men had been never able to write, then to write thus to the ſcandale of Gods Church and his ſacred truth)</hi> might
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19959:77"/> more truly haue been uttered againſt thoſe that haue thus in their writing maintained corrupt popiſh doctrine, then againſt them that haue profitably employed both their tongues and pennes againſt the common Adverſarie.

In that the knee is bowed rather at the name of Ieſus then of Chriſt, or of God the Father, and God the holy Ghoſt, it is evident that this reverence is done to the name, not to the divine Maieſty, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually in all theſe names is to be adored: if then the ſound of the name be adored, it is ſuperſtition: if the perſon, it bringeth an inequality of the Godhead. 3. As well may the name of Ieſus be bowed unto, when it is ſeene painted or written in the glaſſe windowes, as when it is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: for why ſhould not the ſight thereof be as holy to the eye, as the ſound to the eare? And indeed thus a certaine late Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Synode perſwaded to kneele down before an image becauſe the people bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus:</hi> theſe are their words: <hi>Nec maiori idololatriae periculo, quam ad no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Ieſu genu flectitur: quem enim vocula curſim auribus inſinuat, hunc eunde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fidelibus oculis imago repraeſentat.</hi> 4.

               <head>The fifth Article of Subſcription. Reaſons againſt ſubſcription to the book.</head>
               <p>1. MINISTERS were forced to ſubſcribe to many things not warranted by the word: In ſuch caſes the Apoſtle giveth this rule: <hi>to whom we gaue not place by ſubjection, not for an houre: Gal.</hi> 2. 5. And <hi>Hierom</hi> confidently ſaith: <hi>Ego libera voce reclamante mundo profiteor, &amp;c. I doe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ierom. Augustine.</note> 
                  <hi>freely profeſſe though the world ſay nay, that the ceremonies of the Iewes are deadly, and pernicious to Chriſtians, and whoſoever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them is caſt down into the Devils dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.</hi> VVherefore in impoſing ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to Iewiſh onely, but which is worſe to ceremonies uſed in the Popiſh Church, they layd a yoake upon mens ſhoulders too heauy to beare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing the preachers conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all ſubſtantiall points of doctrine, they ſhould haue uſed their Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in ſuch ceremonies according to the Apoſtles rule: <hi>the kingdom of God is not meate nor drink</hi> (nor by the like reaſon <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell) but righteouſneſſe, and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, for whoſoever in thoſe things ſerveth Chriſt is acceptable to God, and approved of men: let us follow thoſe thing</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:19959:99"/> 
                  <hi>which concerne peace, and wherewith one may edifie another. Rom.</hi> 14. 18, 19. Vniformity in ceremonies then ſhould not haue been ſo ſtrictly urged, ſeeing there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent in doctrine, but forbearance ſhould haue been vſed in matters (ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different) for peace ſake: <hi>in una fide nihil officit Eccleſiae ſanctae conſuetudo diuerſa. Toletan.</hi> 5. <hi>can.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>3. Though it had been a fault in the preachers not to be conformable in theſe ceremonies, yet did it not deſerue ſo great a puniſhment, as ſuſpenſion, degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, incarceration, deprivation: that Non-reſidents, idle, ignorant, ſuperſtitious, adulterous Clergie men were not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt as honeſt painful preachers, what was this elſe, but with the Phariſees <hi>to ſtraine at a gnat and ſwallow a Camell.</hi> Such ſeverity in trifles was taxed long ago by <hi>Auguſtine: hoc nimis doleo, &amp;c. this</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>They were wont to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the</hi> 8. <hi>day after baptiſme, Aug. contra Petil.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Aliud eſt quod octave die baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornm nos celebramus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>much greeveth me, that many things whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely commanded in Scriptures, are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured, and all things are ſo full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane preſumptions, that he is more cenſured that in his octaues ſetteth his bare feete upon the ground, then he that is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> over to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe Epiſt.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>4. Profitable miniſters though wanting in ſome externall matters ſhould haue been borne with for the common good of the Church: this courſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> tooke: <hi>what then? yet Chriſt is preached all manner of</hi>

                  <hi>wayes; whether under pretence or ſincerely, I therein ioy, and will ioy: Phil.</hi> 1. 18. Thus <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith well: <hi>Eccleſia numero ſuperata</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Adverſ. Ioan bieroſol.</note>

                  <hi>of the Church ſo requireth.</hi> There was ſmall reaſon to thruſt out preachers for trifles, there being ſuch want of preachers, 4000 Churches in England yet being without. 5, Subſcription was urged by force not by perſwaſion, there was no courſe taken to reſolue them that doubted, and Biſhops peremptorily required ſubſcription, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yeelding any reaſon further, or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the doubtfull contrary to the Apoſtle, who ſaith: <hi>not that we haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over your faith.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p>But they which urged ſubſcription commanded, they perſwaded not mens conſcience, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſome time was more equall, as <hi>Leo,</hi> 1. thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: <hi>plus erga corrigendos agat benevolentia, quàm ſeveritas: plus cohortatio, quàm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio: plus Charitas, quàm poteſtas, &amp;c. with thoſe, that are to be corrected, let Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency prevaile more then ſeverity: cohortation then commination: charity, then authority, but they which ſeeke their own, not Ieſus Chriſts, doe ſwarue from this Law, which</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:19959:100"/> 
                  <hi>ſeek rather to rule then counſell their ſubiects for while honour pleaſeth, pride puffeth up, that which was provided for a remedy to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. Leo epiſt.</hi> 82. <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>6. In the urging of ſubſcription they forget Chriſtian compaſſion ſtripping Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; and ſome of them aged of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings to the undoing of themſelues, their wiues, and children. <hi>Ioſias</hi> ſhewed more compaſſion to the <hi>Chemarims</hi> that were i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Prieſts: who though they were not permitted to come up to the altar, yet did not eate unleavened bread among their brethren. 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 23. 9. they had their maintenance from the temple. The Popes Canons herein were more equall, that pittied old age, as <hi>Gregory</hi> thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth <hi>ſed quia ſimplicitatem tuam cum ſene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctute novimus, interim tacemus: the penall ſentence was ready to be inflicted, but becauſe wee know your ſimplicity ioyned with old age, we hold our peace.</hi> Cauſ. 1. q. 7. can. 11.</p>
               <p>7. This forcing of ſubſcription to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies not warranted by the word, is contrary to the Scriptures and practiſe of the Church: In <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time <hi>Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was required, and an oath of the chiefe of the people, but it was onely <hi>to walk in Gods Law: Neh.</hi> 10. 29. <hi>not to keepe any traditions not written.</hi> VVhen <hi>Victor</hi> would haue forced the Eaſt Churches to keep Eaſter, as the Latine Churches did, and was reſolved to excommunicate them

And certaine Catholicke Biſhops had taken up the like cuſtome to urge ſubſcription. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary was decreed by that Councell: <hi>ut E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi nullus chyrographas, &amp;c. that Biſhops ſhould no more exact ſuch ſubſcription: ſed tantummodo fierent ſolennitates de more, but to be content with the old uſe: they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force no new ſubſcriptions, but keepe the old</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:19959:101"/> 
                  <hi>cuſtomes &amp; ſolennities.</hi> The Biſhops then in urging new ſubſcriptions to combine the Clergy to cleaue unto them, &amp; not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to grant them licenſes to preach, did reviue the corrupt uſe of <hi>Photius</hi> the pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Patriark condemned in this Councell.</p>
               <p>8. To require abſolute ſubſcription to the booke is to make it almoſt equall to the Scripture, as freed from all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but this properly the holy writings onely haue, viz. to bee <hi>perfect, right, pure: Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the ſtatuts of the Lord are right.</hi> VVhat could be required more then to ſubſcribe abſolutely to the word of God, as pure, perfect, and without any errour. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well diſtinguiſheth between divine and humane writing: <hi>de Scripturis canonicis non licet dicere, &amp;c. of the Canonicall Scriptures it is not lawfull to ſay, the Author was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but in other books which are written by us, not with authority of precept, but exerciſe to profit, though there be found the ſame veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yet are they not of the ſame authority, which kind of writing muſt be read not with neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of beleefe, but liberty of iudgement, Aug. cont. Fauſt. l.</hi> 11. 5. But there is now no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t left, but neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe impoſed in this abſolute ſubſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>9. Beſide, this violent courſe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription hath bred a great ſcandale in the Church, &amp; diſturbed the peace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that whereas quietly before Miniſters
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19959:102"/> ioyned together in building the Lords houſe, after the ſame began to be urged, then ſuſpenſions, impriſoning, ſilencing, depriving of many profitable miniſters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Would to God they were cut off that diſquiet you. Gal.</hi> 5. 12. They were diſquieters of the Church that urged the ceremonies, not they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them. Conſcience forced not the one to urge ſubſcription: for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues hold theſe Ceremonies not to bee neceſſary: but conſcience moved the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in not ſubſcribing unto them. VVho were then diſturbers, they which urged thoſe things, which with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might be left: or they which refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe which with a good conſcience they thought they could not uſe. There is a rule in the law, <hi>In rebus dubijs pars tutior ſequenda; In doubtfull matters the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer way is to be followed.</hi> Not to uſe ſuch rites and ceremonies is no ſin: but to yeeld unto them, in him that is not reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is ſinne. The law reſolveth, that the leſſe doubted courſe ſhould be taken, not to uſe them at all. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to <hi>Gemadius: Sicut ij qui mare navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, &amp;c. As they which ſaile in the Sea, when a tempeſt ariſeth, and the ſhip is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, doe diſburden it of ſome things to ſaue the reſt: ſo ſeeing it is not in our power to ſaue all, deſpicimus ex ijs quaedam ne cuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum patiamur diſpendia: Wee ſeeme to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:19959:102"/> 
                  <hi>or winke at ſome things, leſt wee ſhould leeſe all.</hi> So it had been better to haue caſt out ſuch burthenous ceremonies, then to put the ſhip of the Church in hazard, and diſturbe the peace thereof.</p>
               <p>10. The forme of, ſubſcription is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">Subſcription contrary to law.</note> to the law of the land, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by theſe reaſons, 1. The Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſubſcription onely to the Articles of Religion in theſe words, <hi>He ſhall declare</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>his aſſent, and ſubſcribe to all the articles of Religion, which onely concerne, the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true chriſtian faith, and the doctrine of the Sacraments.</hi> But to ſubſcribe to the booke of common praier, doth not onely concerne the confeſſion of true Chriſtian faith: Ergo by the lawe it is not to be ſubſcribed unto.</p>
               <p>2. That which Miniſters doe ſubſcribe unto by law, muſt appeare under the ſeal, teſtimoniall of the Biſhop, and bee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely declared in the Church within two moneths of induction: but neither doth the teſtimoniall make mention of ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the booke, neither is the Miniſter bound to declare his aſſent thereto in the Church: Ergo it is not agreeable to the law.</p>
               <p>3. The law eſpecially enacted concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1, <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12.</note> the booke of Common praier onely puniſheth ſuch as doe not obſerue it, and uſe the rights and ceremonies therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, it puniſheth not ſuch as refuſe to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19959:103"/> ſubſcribe thereunto: ſo that the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth onely obedience in practiſe, not ſubſcription in iudgement to the booke.</p>
               <p>4.

But where lay men farme their tythes, the Miniſters portion is ſcant, and hath not ſufficient maintenance, therefore it is inconvenient that they

               <p>6. The Biſhop and other Cleargy men are bound by the Canons to relieue poore miniſters of their owne, if need ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: <hi>Si quis Epiſcopus aut Preſbyter Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico ex inopia laboranti, &amp;c.

If they are bound to helpe other poore, much more ſuch as are of their owne calling; and if they ought to giue them of their owne, much more to reſtore them that which by right is theirs, and not to enrich lay men, and ſuffer the miniſter to begge.</p>
               <p>7. That is neither Lawfull nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient whereby an vnpreaching Miniſtery is maintayned, and the preaching of the word hindred.

                  <p>Secondly, would our brethren haue the <note place="margin">The Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſtate in earth not Monarchical.</note> ſtate of the Church Monarchicall by this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to make the Eccleſiaſticall and Civill ſtate ſuteable, when there was but one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ambitious policie brought in one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Biſhop the Pope, that tooke upon him to be chiefe over all Biſhops: There is great difference between the Church and the Kingdom: their regiment cannot be alike: Our Saviour himſelfe ſheweth a difference, <hi>The</hi>

                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:19959:153"/> And in this manner was the Church gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the beginning, as <hi>Hierome</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>communi preſbyterorum conſilio: by the common</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>counſell of preſbyters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, yet ſhall it appeare, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment and Diſcipline of the Church, which the Petitioners moue, is much more ſuteable to the ſtate of a Monarchie, then the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Hierarchie: 1. VVee acknowledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monarch, both in Civill and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cauſes, but the kings Maieſty: there need not to be any other Prince, or chiefe of the Biſhops, but the King, 2. the civill ſtate, though it be Monarchicall in the head, yet it is not throughout in the members. The King firſt, hath his honorable ſtate of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, all of equall authority: to that may anſwer for Eccleſiaſticall matters a Synode of Biſhops: then in every ſhire, there are worſhip full knights and Squires in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the peace: were it not a confuſed <note place="margin">The presbyter of Pastors proued ſutea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the state.</note> eſtate, that there ſhould bee but one Iuſtice in a ſhire, as now there is but one Chancellor or Archdeacon? How much more ſuteable were it, if every Deanery and diviſion had their aſſembly and reverent learned Paſtors, for the adminiſtration of diſcipline, then one ignorant Civilian, or ſome other ordinary ſubſtituted perſon? VVee appeale now to all religious politike ſtateſmen, whether this form of Eccleſiaſticall government were not much more fitting to the Commonwealth, then that which now is uſed: VVherefore the Confuters are too blame to charge the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19959:153"/> and their requeſts, as not ſuteable to the ſtate: VVe ſay with <hi>Ambroſe: Didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus omnes fidem proprio regi ſervare, nec uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare regnum ſed vereri: Wee haue learned to bee faitbfull to the Prince, not to uſurpe any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but to reverence the king, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. They further vntruely charge the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, <note place="margin">Vutruth. No ſuch thing will enſue.</note> 
                     <hi>That povertie and lack of learning would creepe into the Clergie if their deſire take place.</hi> Anſw. p. 29.</p>
                  <p>VVhereunto we anſwer. 1. what though there be not ſufficient maintenance left in ſome reformed Churches: VVee pittie their eſtate, and as much condemne the embeaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Church revenues, as theſe cenſurers: And it is an vncharitable ſpeach, that wee would haue our Churches reduced and made conformable to the calamitie of thoſe places: Neither is the povertie of thoſe Churches the fruit of their reformation, but of ſome mens couetouſnes, that are ready to <note place="margin">Vntruth. We would not haue our Church ſo reduced.</note> take any occaſion to enrich themſelues: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the Petitioners urge the alteration of the eccleſiaſticall ſtate, according to their platforme: the Petitioners ſtand for the maintenance of a learned Miniſterie, as it may appeare by their motion of impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and wee ſay with Origen: <hi>Niſi dederit oleum populus, extinguetur lucerna in templo.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hom.</hi> 13. <hi>in levit.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That there are not many men brought up among them (they meane in <hi>Scotland</hi> and other reformed Churches) worthy of that honorable maintenance: is not far from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation of ſo worthy a Church, neither had
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19959:154"/> that land ever more learned men both prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and writers, then are at this time: The Kings own Teſtimony ſhall cleare this point: <hi>There is preſently a ſufficient number of good men of the miniſtry of this kingdom;</hi> How may his Maieſty take it, to haue ſuch an evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port brought up of his countrey.</p>
                  <p>3. Of like truth it is, that the petitioners <note place="margin">Vntruth.</note> here called at their pleaſures <hi>(evill, malicious, ungrateful men)</hi> can ſee nothing in the Church but defects, deformities: VVee neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that which is good for the evill, nor yet iuſtifiy the evill, as they do, together with the good: that were to uſe too little a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and this too large, as one ſaith: <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura maior eſt, quando plus donatur rebus, quam merita depoſcunt; minor, cum ſubtrahitur meritis</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Apol. pamph.</note> 
                     <hi>quod debetur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. VVe wiſh alſo, that all which profeſſe the truth were in our condition, but with S. <hi>Pauls</hi> exception: <hi>Excepting theſe bonds;</hi> our <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 29.</note> ſtate were moſt happy, if this ſervitude under humane conſtitutions were removed.</p>
                  <p>5. And we wiſh with all our hearts it were as they ſay, <hi>That our Reverend Prelates did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne themſelues within ſuch bounds, as preſerue that ſtate from creeping to any papall corruptions:</hi> But how can this be truly ſayd, when as the diſcipline of the Eccleſiaſticall courts is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſame, ſetting the ſupremacy aſide, which was exerciſed under the pope. The corruption is not reformed, being by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authority maintayned: the Canon ſaith: <hi>Cum quid una via prohibetur alieni, ad id alia</hi>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:19959:154"/> 
                     <hi>non debet admitti; That which is forbidden one way, ought not to be admitted an other.</hi> The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, as by the papall ſupremacy, are not now practiſed, ſo by his Maieſties princely authority we truſt ſhall bee purged: to whom the honour of this worke muſt be left, not to the Biſhops themſelues, <hi>to chaine them with ſuch bonds</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>7. If it be admited, that there were more <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſ. to Pet. p.</hi> 31.</note> learned men in this kingdome, then among all the Miniſters of the religion in all <hi>Europe</hi> beſide: that doth not proue, that there are no dumb &amp; unlearned Miniſters in the Church. 1. And where will our brethren find ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men, if they exclude all thoſe preachers which deſire reformation, whom
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19959:155"/> at other times they will hardly afford the name of learning. 2. And it need not to be marvailed at, if <hi>England</hi> may compare in number of learned Paſtors, with moſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med countries (though the compariſon bee too large to ſet it alone againſt all <hi>Europe)</hi> ſeeing in this one land there are more pariſh Churches, which are occaſions of learned Miniſters, then in all the Proteſtant reformed nations. 4. But conſidering the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Pariſhes (which riſeth to not ſo few, asten thouſand) as we may compare for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſtets, ſo we feare wee exceed them for unlearned. <hi>Scotland</hi> hath not the third part of that number, nor the tenth of our maintenance; but there are few Churches which haue not a preaching Miniſter: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we wiſh we could compare with them. 5. As this Church of <hi>England</hi> aboundeth with many learned men; ſo it would abound much more, for every learned miniſter wee ſhould haue two if that courſe might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken which the humble Petitioners deſire: but now as wee haue many bright ſhining lamps, ſo there are more dim twinkling ſtars. The third part of the land is darkened with unpreaching miniſters, that we may ſay with <hi>Origen, Alij ſunt, quorum pars aliqua obſervatur, ut in Revelatione percuſſa eſt tertia pars lunae: alij qui penitus cadunt, ut ſtellae à draconis cauda</hi>

                  <p>8. And true it is, that as our brethren ſay, our inferiour Clergie (even the thouſand preachers Petitioners, with their fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, ſo diſpiſed, &amp; not the dumb idle mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Non-reſidents) <hi>haue been the moſt effectual meanes to ſettle the tranquilitie of the land, by inducing mens mindes unto piety towards God, loyalty to their King:</hi> and to uſe their own words, <hi>as the Apoſtle gaue his detractors to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he was not inferiour to the chiefe Apoſtles; nay, that he laboured more then they all. In like caſe we doubt not, but a truth may be be averred of our ſelues even by our ſelues, without any oſtentation at all, when it is ſo iniuriouſly impeached, and troden under feet, to the high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, the diſgrace of his Goſpell, and to the ſlander of this moſt Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue we anſwered our brethren for this matter with their owne words, but much more truely without any oſtentation of vanity, but in the plaine declaration of verity: and we ſay with <hi>Ambroſe: Non eſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>hoc ulla virtutum iactantia, ſed vita innocentis aſſertio, aliud eſt dignum ſe praemia dicere, aliud indignum iniuria. It is not to boaſt of our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but to avow our innocency: and one thing it is to ſay, that wee are worthy of reward, and another, that we are unworthy of iniury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus for this time haue we ended our iuſt plea, and reply for the truth, leaving the iudgement thereof to your Chriſtian Maieſty: wherein to our knovvledge we haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing which is not conſonant to the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19959:156"/> Scriptures, and agreeable to the ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the primitiue Church. In handling wherof, we humbly craue pardon if we haue been too tedious. Our intendment was not ſo much to confute the gain-ſayers, as to confirme the truth: and we herein follow <hi>Cyprians</hi> counſell; <hi>Semel laboravimus, ne alij</hi>

We haue taken this paines at once, to eaſe other of continuall paines:</hi> That where they doubt they may bee reſolued, where they are wavering, they might bee ſetled, and wherein they haue not yet tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, they may be further informed.</p>
                  <p>Now to your excellent Maieſty we hartily wiſh the compaſſion of <hi>David,</hi> the wiſedom of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the faithfulneſſe and zeale of <hi>Moſes,</hi> both tenderly to pitty, wiſely to diſcerne, and uprightly to determine theſe cauſes and controverſies of the Church (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe excellent graces of <hi>Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Prudencie,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> wherewith God hath enlarged your Princely heart) to the honour of Chriſt, the comfort of his Church, your Maieſties immortal renown in earth, &amp; everlaſting reward in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
